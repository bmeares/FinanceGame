How quickly can you make $10 quadrillion?

Play Accountant Simulator to find out how quickly you can own all the wealth on Earth just by cooking the books!

In all honesty, this game is a test program I wrote to learn GitHub but became a little too invested in.

The goal of the game is to buy goods, increase their values, and sell them. You can do that by either improving them
(buying services) or by investing directly. You can only improve a good once, and you cannot invest in a good that's
already been improved. Feel free to invest as many times as you want, but you can't invest more than a good is worth.

A typical game lasts between 20 and 40 minutes; however, this version includes a save feature, so you can rest at ease
that your game data will be safe when you exit the program!
